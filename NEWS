ABOUT 0.2.2: This release only involves license changes.

That's a 'fix things' release... so no new stage, sorry.

I've had several reports about DD2's Joystick support working :D 

"freakdave" <freakdave@gmx.de> has repported DD2 0.2 works in the X-Box
game console, but it has some problems. I've tried to fix such problems:

	-Use first Joystick in menu (1st but. select, 2nd but. exit)
	-Joystick should work in hiscores (UP/DOWN and RIGHT, 1st but.
	 finish, 2nd but. delete)
	-While playing with Joystick, 2nd but. is pause
	-Now you can play DD2 with two Joysticks

I've added support to systems with just one CONTROL key. You should
configure the package with --enable-alternate-fire-key switch in
order to use 'm' key instead RIGHT CONTROL.
